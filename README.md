### Motivation

As pet owners, we often have the urge to bring our pets out to meet, play or socialise with other pets. However, there is currently no easy way to do this besides meeting other pet owners from our own social circle. Apart from Facebook groups, there are no centralised digital platforms for pet owners to interact, socialize or advise one another on pet ownership. We want to be the first to conceptualise such an application; one that connects pet owners nearby in ways that will enhance their experience as pet owners.

Furthermore, as a pet owner for 17 years, the lack of digitization of the pet industry is frustrating. Services like vet and grooming appointments mostly require manual booking through phone calls, which is not ideal in this technology age. We aim to be the first to digitize every aspect of being a pet owner, all encompassed into one platform. Pet Social will be a hybrid website that will serve as a social media for pet owners, as well as a platform for services like booking Vet appointments and Shopping for pet accessories.
